### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
Bicyle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B. In this project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the U.S., to uncover bike share usage patterns. This project will compare three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.
